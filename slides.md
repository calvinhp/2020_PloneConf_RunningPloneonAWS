::: notes
tidbit of trivia, the chances of a snowflake being exactly alike is 1 in 1 million trillion (that's a 1 followed by 18 zeros)

We are now in the world of DevOps and many non-cloud native applications have the ability to be deployed with cloud native tools.
How do we take a beautiful handcrafted bare-metal server running our application to translate that into the cloud?

::: notes
College of Engineering at Notre Dame has been hosting their main web site on a single server in a closet on campus since we deployed it for them back in 2011.

In 2016 the university mandated a move to AWS campus wide.

Perfect opportunity to take this aging single server hosting their site and improve their performance and resilience to potential failure.

::: notes

How do we get a fresh Salt master into a region to start building the rest of the infrastructure.

SaltStack has support for various cloud providers, but the easiest was to just use Python and Boto3 to bootstrap the process.

A few lines of Python and you have a VPC ready to be your command and control in any region.

:::

# Orchestrate!

```sh
$ salt-run state.orchestrate orch.deploy-environment pillarenv=prod
```

And build a `test` environment

```sh
$ salt-run state.orchestrate orch.deploy-environment pillarenv=test
```

# Sounds too easy {.semi-filtered data-background-image="https://c1.staticflickr.com/1/229/498818720_73a25bdf70_o.jpg"}

The road was bumpy for sure.

Satisfying the rules for no special cases was tricky.

> There should be one, and preferably only one, obvious way to do it.
> Although that way may not be obvious at first unless you're Dutch.

Or you could flesh out the Copilot CLI bits to enable more junior devs
